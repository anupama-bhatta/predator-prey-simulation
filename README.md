# Predator-Prey Simulation

## Description

This repository contains a Java-based web application that simulates predator-prey interactions within a 2D environment. Flies act as prey, while spiders serve as predators.

## Features

- **Dynamic Simulation**: Models interactions between flies (prey) and spiders (predators).
- **Graphical Interface**: Includes visual representations of organisms and their movements.
- **Two Versions**: Offers two implementations to explore different simulation approaches.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust simulation parameters, such as grid size and organism behaviors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java** installed on your system.
- An IDE like **NetBeans** for running the project.

### Steps to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., NetBeans).
3. Navigate to either the **`Simulation-I/`** or **`Simulation-II/`** directory.
4. Compile and run the **`Program.java`** file in the **`src/`** folder.
5. Observe the predator-prey interactions in real time.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for development.
- **NetBeans**: IDE used for building and running the project.

## File Structure

- **`Simulation-I/`**: Contains source code and assets for the first simulation version.
- **`Simulation-II/`**: Contains source code and assets for the second simulation version.
- **`.DS_Store`**: macOS system file (ignore).
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file with project details and instructions.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., NetBeans).
2. Navigate to the **`src/`** folder within either **`Simulation-I/`** or **`Simulation-II/`**.
3. Run the **`Program.java`** file.
4. View the simulation:
   - Watch as flies and spiders interact in a dynamic 2D grid.
   - Explore patterns of predator-prey dynamics with ease.
