## Overview:

This repository contains two versions of a predator-prey simulation developed in Java. In each simulation, flies represent prey, while spiders act as predators. The simulations provide a basic 2D environment where users can observe the dynamics between predators and prey.

## Usage:

To run the simulation, you can compile and execute the Java files using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as NetBeans. The simulations provide an interactive environment where users can observe the behaviors of flies and spiders as they interact with each other. Whether you're a student exploring ecological dynamics or a developer interested in simulation programming, these simulations offer valuable insights into predator-prey relationships.
